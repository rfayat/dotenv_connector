# dotenv connector

Done
- [x] First working version of the code

Low-hanging fruits
- [ ] Cleaner doc with examples
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Setup instructions
- [ ] Better input parsing (.env files only tolerate strings)

Longer-term
- [ ] Replace .env file by json -> Nested dictionaries, more flexible when it comes to the data type
